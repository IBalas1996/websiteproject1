		<h2>
			<q>Treat the Patient not the Disease; Treat the Cause not the Effect</q> ~ Edward Bach</h2>
		<p>At Dr. Balas Chiropractics &amp; Holistic Healthcare, the causes of any and all health problems are put first over symptom treatment. Many factors like physical stress and emotional blockage disserve our bodies and then to be the root of many modern day health problems. If you are looking for a holistic approach, look no further!</p>

<p>God created your body to be healthy. <strong>There is a power within each one of us which is our gift from God.</strong> That power is called life, and it flows from the brain to the spinal cord and over the nerves to each cell, organ, tissue, and system within the body. Physical, chemical, and emotional stress can cause blockages in the way life is expressed in the body. The block in the expression of life leads to malfunction, dis-ease, and symptoms. <strong>By correcting those blockages, we realign you to the power within called <em>life.</em></strong> Only that power can restore <strong><em>function, healing, and health from within.</em></strong> The only thing that comes between you and your health is your body not functioning and healing properly. There is no condition or symptom that God cannot heal.<strong><em>All we do is provide the proper environment so that healing may take place from within..</em></strong>
